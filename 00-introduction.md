This repository contains exercises for the PowerShell training.

There are a few minor requirements if you want to follow this course:
- Have a computer. Windows 10 is preferred. Older versions of Windows will work for most exercises. You can also follow this training with an Apple computer or a computer running Linux. Most exercises will work on those systems also.
- Have a basic understanding of computers. For example, I assume you know what a process is. What a service or a daemon is. And have some experience with computer networking (ping a computer).
