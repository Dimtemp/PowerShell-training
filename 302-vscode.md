# Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (or VS Code) is the preferred editor for using PowerShell files. It's open-source, cross-platform, extensible, and used by many programmers using different languages, e.g. C#, Python, Rust and others. 

Other editors might include:
- Visual Studio: this is the full-blown IDE (integrated development environment). For PowerShell it migt be overkill.
- Windows PowerShell ISE (integrated scripting environment). This is unofficially end-of-life. It is included with Windows, and not useable on other operating systems. Also, it's optimized for PowerShell, and not other languages or file formats.
- Notepad++. Just like VS Code, this is a free, multi language editor. It can process many different files and formats. 

**Bottom line:** make sure your editor has the features that you need for working with PowerShell files. Integration with version control, a proper linter, and an adaptable GUI might be important aspects.
